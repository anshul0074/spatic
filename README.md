Problem Statement
Given a dataset with entries consisting of latitude, longitude, and name, write a Python program to identify entries that are within 200 meters of each other and have similar names.

Input
The input dataset is provided as a CSV file with the following columns:

name : The name of the place
latitude: The latitude of the place in degrees
longitude: The longitude of the place in degrees

Output
The output of the program will be a CSV file with all the entries which satisfy the given criteria of similarity marked as True / 1 in a separate column named is_similar.

Similarity Criteria
Two entries are considered similar if they satisfy the following criteria:

They are within 200 meters distance from each other.
The maximum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other should be less than 5.
Approach
The program reads the input CSV file and stores the data in a list of tuples. The program uses the geopy library to calculate the distance between two latitude and longitude points in meters. The program also uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm to calculate the edit distance between two strings.

The program then iterates over all possible pairs of entries in the data and checks if they are within 200 meters of each other and have a Levenshtein distance less than or equal to 5. If so, the program appends the entries to a list of results with 1. Otherwise if no match is found for a particular row , then it appends the row to the list of results with 0. 

Finally, the program writes the results to an output CSV file with an additional column is_similar which is marked as True / 1 for the entries that satisfy the given criteria and False / 0 for those entries for which there is no match.

Dependencies
The program uses the following Python libraries:

csv: for reading and writing CSV files.
geopy: for calculating the distance between two latitude and longitude points.
Usage
To use the program, the input CSV file must be named dataset.csv and placed in the same directory as the Python script. The program can be run using the following command:

python program.py

The output file results.csv will be generated in the same directory as the Python script. The output file will have the same format as the input file with an additional column is_similar which indicates whether the entry is similar to another entry according to the given criteria.
